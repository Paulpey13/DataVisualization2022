All the code for cleaning, processing and creating new dataframe are in ProjetPerso.rmd
 
﻿Three plot are in ShinySecondTry.r

﻿One interactive plot is in ReactivePlot(slide11).r

﻿All the fetching files is in fetch_and_transform2.r

﻿The rest is different database used in my project
 
﻿Normally everything is good but if a plot is not showing, a database must be missing, you can write me at paul.peyssard@etu.univ-cotedazur.fr
