This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
artists <- read.csv("/Users/youssefbouchida/Downloads/M1 DSAI/DATA VIZ/DataBaseHipHopOnly/Artist_HipHop_Only.csv")
head(artists)
```

```{r}
head(artists)
```


```{r}
artists <- artists[, -5]
#artists <- artists[, -c(4:9)]
head(artists)
```

```{r}
artists$locationInfo <- sapply(strsplit(artists$locationInfo, ","), "[",1 )
artists <- artists[!artists$deezerFans== "NULL", ] 
#artists <- artists %>% drop_na()
head(artists,100)
nrow(artists)
```

```{r}
#artists[order(artists$deezerFans)]
#artists[order(artists$deezerFans,artists$locationInfo),]
arrange(artists, deezerFans, locationInfo)
```
```{r}
artists$deezerFans <- as.numeric(as.character(artists$deezerFans))

```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
artists3 <- artists %>% group_by(locationInfo) %>% top_n(5, deezerFans)
#artists %>% filter(locationInfo == "United States") %>% arrange(deezerFans)
```

```{r}
#artists %>% group_by(deezerFans) %>% top_n(5, deezerFans)
artists %>% filter(locationInfo == "Spain") %>% arrange(deezerFans)

```


```{r}
head(artists3,100)
```
```{r}
write.csv(artists3,"/Users/youssefbouchida/viz.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
