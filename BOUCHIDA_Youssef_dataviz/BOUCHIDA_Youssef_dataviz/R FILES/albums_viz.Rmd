This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
albums_up <- read.csv("/Users/youssefbouchida/Downloads/wasabi_albums.csv")
```

```{r}
head(albums_up)
```
```{r}
#albums_up <- albums_up[, -7] #removes the column number
albums_up <- albums_up[, -c(10:11)]
head(albums_up)
```
```{r}
library(stringr)
albums_up$id_artist<-gsub("ObjectId","",as.character(albums_up$id_artist)) #removing that weird objectid thing
#str_replace_all(albums_up$id_artist, "[^[:alnum:]]", "")
head(albums_up)

```


```{r}
library(tidyr)
albums_up <- albums_up %>% drop_na()
head(albums_up)
```


```{r}
#nrow(albums_up)
albums_up %>% filter(genre == "Hip Hop") 

```


```{r}
albums_up %>% filter(genre == "Hip Hop") 
#%>% arrange(deezerFans)

```
```{r}
head(albums_up)

```

```{r}
albums_up <- albums_up %>% filter(albums_up$genre == "Hip Hop") 
head(albums_up)
```
```{r}
nrow(albums_up)
```
```{r}
albums_up2 <- albums_up %>% drop_na()
```

```{r}
head(albums_up2)
```

```{r}
albums_up2$publicationDate <- as.numeric(as.character(albums_up2$publicationDate))

```


```{r}
albums_up2 %>% filter(between(publicationDate, 2008, 2022))

```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
albums_up2 %>% group_by(country) %>% top_n(5, deezerFans)
```
```{r}
albums_up3 <- albums_up2 %>% group_by(country) %>% top_n(5, deezerFans)

```

```{r}
write.csv(albums_up3,"./Downloads/albums_up3.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
